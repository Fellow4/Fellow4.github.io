## About Me

I am a third year CS Ph.D. student in the [Theory group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/) and [Prof. Vatsal Sharan](https://vatsalsharan.github.io/). I am broadly interested in online learning and statistical learning theory. 

Previously, I was a research assistant in the [Signal Processing in Networking (SPiN) lab](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/spinlab/index.html), [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK)](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). I am quite privileged to have collaborated with  [Prof. Rahul Vaze](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vaze/) ([Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/)) during this period.

Before that, I graduated from IITK with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am very fortunate to have been supervised by [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/) during my undergraduate.

I am quite passionate about blues and rock music and have been playing guitar (fingerstyle acoustic and electric) for a while. 
## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in online learning and learning theory. More specifically, my research interests include theoretical foundations of trustworthy machine learning, e.g., calibration, multicalibration, omniprediction, and aspects of online learning, which includes fast algorithms for swap regret minimization.

<!-- - **Calibration:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

<!-- <!-- ## News -->

<!-- - **[July. 2025]** Presented our work on swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction, and KL-Calibration at EC'25 -->
